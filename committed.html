// ✨ FULL LETTER WITHOUT ISHQ MUBARAK
const mainText = `I’m writing this for the last time, not to convince you of anything, but to say what I should have said earlier with a clear mind. I know you already have someone in your life, and I genuinely respect that. I also know I’ve disturbed you more than I should have, and that’s on me. I don’t want to be another source of stress for you, and I’m not going to pretend I wasn’t annoying sometimes — I was.

But even through all of that, one thing is absolutely true: I’m proud of you. Proud that you stayed loyal, proud that you stood by your partner, and proud that you didn’t compromise your relationship for anyone. That says a lot about the kind of person you are, and it’s exactly why you deserve happiness without distractions.

From today, this annoying guy steps out of your way for good. I won’t disturb you again. I want you to grow, to smile, and to live your life peacefully with the choices you believe in. You deserve that, and I genuinely mean it.

Wish you all the best for everything ahead — may your future be bright, calm, and filled with the happiness you choose.
